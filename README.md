# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hello! ðŸ˜€ I'm **Cheng**(she/her), currently studying at Carnegie Mellon University's PPM-DA. I'm from China, and passionate about data analysis and visualization. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring Pittsburgh's diverse food scene and taking walks in nearby parks! I also like travelling and photograph, and this is my video website: [Cheng's Notes](https://space.bilibili.com/14696857?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0)
