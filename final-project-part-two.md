# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience

The primary audience for my story includes individuals who may not currently pay attention to issues of fairness in the context of energy transition—such as policymakers, investors, and the general public.

## Approach to Identifying Interviewees

I selected interviewees from diverse backgrounds and countries. Some are studying energy policy, some are originally from West Virginia, and others have expertise in data analysis. Their varied perspectives provided valuable insights into different aspects of my project.


## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

Hi, thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. This is a project for my “Telling Stories with Data” course, aiming to use data to inspire action. My project focuses on energy equity in West Virginia.

**Warm-up (before showing wireframes)**:
 - Are you familiar with the economic or energy situation in West Virginia?
 - Do you have any particular thoughts or opinions about it?
**Show the storyboard/storyline**
**Main questions (after showing)**:
 - Does the overall flow make sense to you?
 - Is the story engaging? Does it have emotional ups and downs?
 - Do you think my conclusion should be more focused or more open-ended? (Because the ideas of a previous interviewee and advice from the professor are a little different)
 - Who do you think my audience is?


## Interview findings
1. Strengths to Keep:

Interviewees found that starting with a personal story made the narrative easy to understand and engaging. They also thought the topic was fresh and well-focused.

2. Broadening the Theme:

Several interviewees were drawn in by the fact that, despite the push for renewable energy, there are still negative impacts for some people. They suggested expanding the topic to “humans of non-renewable”—using West Virginia as a case study, but also acknowledging similar stories elsewhere.

The revised storyline would be:
 - Introduce the background
 - Highlight the issue: people left behind in the energy transition
 - Emphasize the core message: these are real people who deserve protection and opportunities. As we shift to a green future, they should not be excluded.
 - This makes the audience broader: policymakers might consider equity in future energy policies; new investors could see opportunities to hire displaced workers or offer retraining; and the general public may gain a more nuanced understanding of the human side of the energy transition.

3. Expanding the Data:

One interviewee recommended finding more robust data and telling a stronger story with it. Since my focus is now on all workers affected by the energy transition, not just those in West Virginia, I need to seek higher-level and more granular data from multiple regions.




# Identified changes for Part III

Based on this feedback (even though I had already revised my storyline once), I decided to shift the theme to “humans of non-renewable.” While my previous policy memo targeted mainly policymakers, with this Shorthand project I hope to reach a broader audience—so that people from different professions can take away something meaningful and perhaps be inspired to act. I also realized that this new storyline would be more accessible and engaging for my classmates when I present it, making the topic easier to understand and more compelling. Going forward, I will focus on finding more comprehensive and diverse data and refining my visualizations to highlight the human stories behind the numbers.
This revised version is ready for your GitHub portfolio page and clearly addresses all parts of the assignment.
