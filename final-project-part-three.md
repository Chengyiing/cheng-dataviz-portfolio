# Changes, Audience, and What Helped Me since Part II

I found the professor’s feedback on Part II especially inspiring. 

First, the comment about what makes my story interesting really resonated with me: 
> “Here at CMU and most people that I personally know assume that Green Energy is simply the 'go-to.' ...However, your story shows the flip side of that: there are people—entire communities at the local and state level—that still rely on 'old' energy such as Coal Mining for their livelihood. This alone brings up an interesting cross-roads.”

This feedback helped me decide on the tone for my final presentation: I wanted to speak directly to my audience, starting with “We all know green energy is a good thing… but do you know this transition isn’t fair?”

Second, defining my audience was the trickiest and most confusing part. My instructor gave many examples—maybe my audience could be green energy environmentalists, or West Virginia investors, or East Coast policymakers. I realized that in future projects, it might be valuable to clearly distinguish between these audiences and personalize my work for each. But for this project, I wanted my audience to be general. I assumed they were not familiar with the uneven impacts of the energy transition, so my main goal was to raise awareness. I believe that simply drawing more attention to this issue is already important, and I wanted my call to action to be flexible. I didn’t want to force everyone toward a single action, but rather hoped that different people—whether policymakers or investors—could take away something meaningful based on their own perspectives and experiences. For example, policymakers might focus more on equity in future legislation, and investors might consider the lives of displaced workers in their future decisions.

Finally, I realized my call to action needed to be more tangible. My instructor suggested: 
> “Can I click a button to learn more? Can I sign up for a newsletter or sign my name on a petition to support Old Energy given that it's been fundamental to the country's building?”
Although I was still torn—because I didn’t want to push my broad audience toward a single prescribed action—I ultimately chose to say, “If you want to learn more, you can choose…” I included links to three NGOs that support displaced workers (such as retraining programs), as well as a YouTube video about environmental justice, hoping that those interested (including my classmates) would be encouraged to explore further.


# Key Reflections and What I Learned

I learned a lot from watching other students’ presentations. For example, I really liked how some classmates used slides for their one-minute pitch, rather than relying on flashy Shorthand animations. I realized that clarity and simplicity are crucial for the audience to absorb information. That’s why I also created a slide with only a few of my key data visualizations. I also noticed that information should be concise, with low color saturation, and the language should be accessible and easy to understand. One classmate’s presentation about LLM performance stood out to me because he spoke at a moderate pace and used plain language instead of technical jargon, which made the content much more approachable. So, when preparing my own presentation (I wrote my script in advance), I cut out a lot of detail, simply raised the core question, pointed out that we’re at a crossroads, and ended with a call to action—successfully finishing within one minute. Admittedly, I was very tired and unexpectedly nervous on stage, so I don’t think I performed my best, but I still hope my story resonated with my classmates and maybe even inspired some of them. At the end of class, I reflected on the relationship between story and data. I’ve always felt that I start with a story and then look for data to support my argument. But the instructor emphasized that, once you have the data, the real skill is extracting the story from the data itself. That’s something I want to work on in the future.
